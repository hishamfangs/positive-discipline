   - Employ a refined palette: ocean teals, sunset corals, creamy neutrals, and deep plum accents.
   - Pair an elegant serif (e.g., Playfair Display) for headlines with a clean sans-serif (e.g., Manrope) for body copy.

2. **Navigation & Layout**
   - Sticky, translucent navigation with smooth scroll anchors: About, Workshops, Experience, Locations, Testimonials, Schedule, Contact.
   - Responsive mobile menu with a hamburger toggle.

3. **Hero Section**
   - Full-height lifestyle slider with 3 slides that rotate automatically and can be controlled via dots.
   - Copy emphasises compassionate leadership, interactive learning, and the Dubai/Cairo community.
   - Primary CTA: “Reserve Your Spot”; secondary CTA links to workshop tracks.

4. **About Nagwa**
   - Split layout featuring a collage of lifestyle images, a heartfelt pull quote, bio paragraph, highlight list, and impact metrics (families supported, schools trained, etc.).

5. **Workshop Tracks**
   - Three feature cards (Parents of Young Explorers, Schools & Educators, Corporate Wellbeing) with image headers, bullet benefits, and location tags.

6. **Experience Snapshot**
   - “Inside the Room” section describing interactive labs, community circles, and action plans with a small photo grid.

7. **Locations**

12. **Footer**
    - Logo reprise, mission statement, contact details, phone numbers for UAE and Egypt, and social links.

## Interactions & Polish
- Use Intersection Observer or scroll-triggered animations to reveal sections gracefully.
- Ensure hero and testimonial sliders auto-advance but support manual control.
- Apply soft shadows, rounded corners, glassmorphism touches, and gradient overlays for a premium-yet-playful feel.
- Optimise for accessibility: semantic HTML, descriptive alt text, focus states, and sufficient color contrast.

## Deliverables
- `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` implementing the design and interactions.
- Responsive breakpoints for tablets and mobile.
- Optional: Provide curated Unsplash image URLs for lifestyle photography directly in CSS backgrounds.
